            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to a set of concepts, technologies, and methods that aim at making computers think and learn likes human. <br>
            It’s a new field of study focusing on making computers ‘smart’ – performing tasks without any human instructions and intervention. <br>
           
           AI, machine learning, and big data are transforming core processes and models of every industry including healthcare,
           transportation, advertising, entertainment, education, manufacturing, retail, etc. 
           Global spending on AI systems will reach $97.9 billion in 2023, according to IDC (International Data Corporation).<br>
           <em style="background-color: pink;"> The term was coined by John McCarthy in 1955.</em>

                The future of AI holds significant changes in data management, decision-making, personalized experiences, and cognitive intelligence. <br>

                It involves fields like computer science, mathematics, philosophy, machine learning, and linguistic. <br>
                
                AI simply improves services and products and doesn’t replace human jobs. <br>
                AI-driven services are gaining popularity using a wide range of tools and technologies. <br>
                 AI continues to broaden its scope in every industry, in every country.
